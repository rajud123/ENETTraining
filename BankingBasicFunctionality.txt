Mode of money transfer :
------------------------------
Under corporate Internet Banking we have 24+ modes of fund transfer out of which below three are the main modes of payment transfer.

1. Acc- to-Acc
2.NEFT(National Electronic Fund Transfer)
3.RTGS(Real Time Gross Settlement)

1. Account to Account:
The transactions that are done within one bank network are called Account to Account transfer 
under this mode there is no reporting to RBI.
eg: from HDFC one bank to another HDFC bank or same HDFC bank.

NEFT(National Electronic Fund Transfer):
The transactions happen between two different banks beween the transfer RBI comes in between.
The flow of transfer is like this 
	eg: HDFC(remitter) -> RBI -> SBI(benificary)

RTGS(Real Time Gross Settlement):
RTGS is combination of  NEFT and Acc-to-Acc but if the fund transfer exceeds 2,00,000 we have to choose this mode of transfer.

below we have the other modes of transfer in ENET :
->IMPS(Immediate Payment Service) : This is similar to NEFT but these are chargable so they take less time to complete the transfer. 

->FLA Acc-to-Acc
->Bulk payments

->Special payment
->Broker payout
->Salary peyment
->Single payment
->Hundie NEFT

All of these are similar but for customers customisation these are seggregated into multiple types.

ENET have 5 roles authorization

i. corporate inputer

iv. confirmer
v.verifier
