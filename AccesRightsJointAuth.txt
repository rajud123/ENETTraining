We have 3 applications
i.ENETAdmin(for bank for Domain, Company, User creation)
ii.ENETMVC(for corporate bank)
iii. SSL(for easy view)

->Admin from bank creates users for corporate bank and provides his credentials, so user can login to the corporate application and handles payments.
->Users make two type payments.
	i.)Bulk payment
	ii.)On screen payment

Access Rights:
-----------------
Whenever inputer initiates transaction authorizer authorizes transaction, but the authorizer has right(access) to authorize only upto some amount those rights are called access rights.
These rights are provided by the admins for the user under Acces rights section in Adminstration tab so the admin provides access limit for the user to some amount to authorize.

For bulk upload got to Cash management tab
The file(CSV file) we are uploading and the client code should be same.
